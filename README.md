# stock-price-prediction-using-LSTM

Overview


This project aims to predict the closing prices of stocks using historical stock price data. The data is obtained from Yahoo Finance, preprocessed, and then used to train an LSTM model. The model is evaluated on test data, and the predicted prices are plotted against the actual prices for comparison

Features


Fetch historical stock price data using yfinance.
Preprocess data for LSTM model training.
Build and train an LSTM model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
Visualize the actual vs. predicted stock prices.

Prerequisites


Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebook)
Required Python libraries: yfinance, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib
